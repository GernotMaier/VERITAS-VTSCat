notes: |
  In TeVCat, there's two sources listed for SN 1006:
  - SN 1006 NE = HESS J1504-418
  - SN 1006 SW = HESS J1502-421
  I (Christoph Deil) prefer to have it as one source,
  because it's one cosmic accelerator.
  This is consistent with other SNRs that are also not
  split into multiple sources.
