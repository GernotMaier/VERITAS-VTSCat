# VTSCat - the VERITAS data catalogue

<a name="intro"></a>
## Introduction

**VTSCat** is the catalog of high-level data products from all publications of the [VERITAS collaboration](https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/).


The **VTSCat** data collection contains:

- high-level data like spectral flux points, light curves, spectral fits in human- and machine-readable yaml and ecsv file format
- tabled data like upper limits tables from dark matter searches or results on the extragalactic background in ecsv file format
- sky maps (wherever available) in FITS file format

The data collection contains results from gamma-ray measurements only. Multiwavelength data like X-ray light curves and spectra will probably be added in a future release.

VTSCat supplements the HEASARC catalogue of VERITAS results (to be published). It is inspired and derived from [gamma-cat](https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat).

VTSCat is currently in the pre-release state and tested. Please checkout [this branch](https://github.com/VERITAS-Observatory/VERITAS-VTSCat/tree/pre-release-v01a) for the data files.
